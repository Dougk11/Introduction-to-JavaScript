returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights

Feeding Requirements:

Adult Dogs 1 year and older

Puppies less than 1 year

   7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
